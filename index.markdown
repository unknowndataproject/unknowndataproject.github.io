Research data is essential to facilitate scientific progress, yet,
many valuable datasets are hidden on web sites and small repositories
or are hard to find due to insufficient metadata. Only a fraction of
researchers pro-actively share dataset metadata through public
portals, and curation of such metadata collections is costly. Unknown
Data will provide means to automatically discover, extract, and
publish metadata about research data that is hidden on the Web or in
scholarly publications. Thus, the project's goal is to **improve
findability and re-usability of research data** by

1. improving metadata quality, in particular with respect to authority
and use of existing datasets and
2. uncovering datasets that are not yet reflected in public data
repositories and registries.Our approach (1) utilises data citations
from scholarly articles and web pages to collect metadata about
relevant datasets,
2. discovers datasets and their context by crawling web pages,
3. consolidates metadata by linking information from domain-specific
databases,
4. facilitates high metadata quality by establishing a
discipline-specific curation process, and (5) ensures long-term
availability of original data sources by archiving relevant web pages.
