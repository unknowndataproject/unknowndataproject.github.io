<p><strong>Project motivation</strong> is to build an automatic system to summarize scientific results and consolidation of metadata for research to increase findability and reusability of research data. <i>Metadata</i> is defined as as the data providing information about one or more aspects of the data, it is used to summarize basic information about data which can make tracking and working with specific data easier.</p>

<p>The aim is to increase the findability and reusability of research data by:</p>
<p> (a) improving the quality of the metadata, in particular regarding the provenance and reuse of the data, and</p>
<p>(b) making data sets visible that cannot yet be found in public repositories.</p>
<p> Therefore, aim is make the resources accesible to everyone. In nutshell, <strong>democratizing data.</strong></p>
